#### Introduction
Lemon3d is an experimental purpose project, written with a minimalistic modular design philosophy. Its built from the ground up to focus on cache friendly data layouts in multicore environments with entity-component based architecture.

Warning: Its far from a stable version right now.

#### Why Rust ?
First of all, this is a part-time toy project of myself,  so i don't really care if we ever have a game engine written in Rust.

And the most importantly, it makes sense for me to take the numerous advantages of modern programming language, instead of using languages like C/C++ which have many historical burden. In fact, this project has beed development with C++ for about four months, which produce a basic multi-thread [framework](https://github.com/drunkenme/lemon-toolkit), and much more pains.
